# About this repository

This repository contains simple and, depending on the success, more complex applications. I created the project to demonstrate the capabilities of "local" LLM models and tools such as Aider-AI. 

## Personal goal

The main goal is that the applications are created purely by LLMs with the help of certain tools without having to make changes to the application code, which means that errors can only be eliminated by the LLMs themselves and intervention is only permitted via the prompt.


## app's
